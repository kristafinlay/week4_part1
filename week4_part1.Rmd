```

## 1. Confidence intervals associated with a sample

```{r}
otter_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 32, 41, 48, 60, 43)

t.test(otter_length)
# how to calculate a confidence interval for a single sample
```

## T- test: 1 sampple t-test

See a claim: mean otter length is 50 inches

```{r}
otter_test <- t.test(x = otter_length, mu = 50)

# to see the one sample t- test data, i call it
otter_test
```


## Two sample t-tests

```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 20)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 40, 42, 26, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)

```
